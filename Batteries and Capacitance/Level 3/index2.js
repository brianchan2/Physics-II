/*
    The flash on a camera is provided by a capacitor discharging 
    through a flashlamp. Suppose in your camera the capacitor is charged by a 9.00 V battery, and the discharge takes 3.50 Î¼s. If the average power dissipated in the flashlamp is 17.8 W, 
    what must the capacitance of the capacitor be?
