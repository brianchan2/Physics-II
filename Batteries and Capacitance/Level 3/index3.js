// For fun, you decide to build a circuit, 
// but you have an unknown capacitor laying around. 
// To measure it, you place it in series with a 5.20 Î¼F 
// capacitor you have and connect them to a 4.50 V battery. 
// Using your trusty voltmeter, you measure 2.50 V across the 
// unknown capacitor. What is its capacitance?
